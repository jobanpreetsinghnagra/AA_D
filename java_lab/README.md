# Java Practicals Collection

This directory contains solutions to 20 common Java practical programs, each in its own file. Each file is self-contained and can be compiled and run independently.

## Requirements
- **Java Version:** 8 or higher (recommended: Java 11+)
- **Compiler:** javac (comes with JDK)

## How to Compile and Run
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the `java` directory:
   ```
   cd java
   ```
3. Compile a program (for example, `Calculator.java`):
   ```
   javac Calculator.java
   ```
4. Run the compiled program:
   ```
   java Calculator
   ```

> For applet programs, you may need to use an older JDK (Java 8 or below) and a browser or applet viewer that supports Java applets.

> For JDBC programs, ensure you have the appropriate JDBC driver (e.g., MySQL Connector/J) in your classpath and a running database instance.
